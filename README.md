# EEG_Drowsiness_detection
the raw data uses 10-20 EEG so but we only use the channel T7 T8 P7 P8 O1 O2 Oz Cz
the raw wave data is cut in to epoch of 5 secs and is filter with 1Hz and 60Hz noises
the raw data is then transform in to corresponding power spectral density plot using FFT
then we analyze the power density in each channel, the interest is in alpha and theta band
